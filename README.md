# Mastering ML
Some tasks that I solved in the framework of mastering ML
1)KNN, knn.py, metrics.py - Implementation of the algorithm of the nearest neighbor method on image data using only the numpy library
2) Basic_pipeline - the basic task of working out the pipeline of calling the model is from processing the source data to checking the model on the metric
3) Linear classifier.ipynb - Implementing a linear classifier, counting gradients and training with SGD with your own hands.
